**Azure Data Piepline**
<img align = "right" src="/docs/assets/pipeline2.png" width="467" height="301" hspace="20" vspace="20">

In this project, we create a simple data pipeline that copies customer csv file into a container and performs K means clustering algorithm in the Databricks notebook. The output dataframe is then stored in separate folder within the same container. 

Tools: Azure Data Factory, Azure Blob Storage, Databricks, PySpark, Python

**Customer Transactions Data Engineering Pipeline**
<img align = "left" src="/docs/assets/pipeline.png" width="358" height="181" hspace="20" vspace="20">


In this project, we create a data pipeline for customer transactions. The initial data stream will be e-commerce sales in JSON format that will be stored in AWS S3 Bucket. First, we create AWS IAM user to generate key and token. Next, we create two S3 buckets. Then, we create database and table in Snowflake and connect to S3 to retrieve files. Finally, we create two snowflake tables to load and transform the data. We can then write the data back into another S3 bucket. 

Tools: SQL, Snowflake, AWS S3 Buckets, AWS Lambda, JSON, Apache Airflow

**Stock Sentiment Analysis**

<img align = "left" src="/docs/assets/tsla.png" width="400" height="250" hspace="20" vspace="20">

Financial markets are hard to predict, but sentimental analysis is an increasingly popular method to gauge the general opinion on financial assets. In this project, we utilize an NLP model to conduct sentiment analysis on tweets related to stocks. The results of this model can help us better understand the correlation between public sentiment and stock price movement. 

Tools Used: Twitter API, Flair (NLP), Pandas, yfinance, Regular Expression

**Credit Card Fraud Detection**
<img align = "right" src="/docs/assets/cc.png" width="418" height="206" hspace="20" vspace="20">

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fradulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. In this project, we develop a machine learning model to identify fradulent credit card transactions. 

Tools Used: Pandas, Logistic Regression, sklearn



**Option Pricing Models**
<img align = "right" src="/docs/assets/options3.png" width="360.5" height="246" hspace="20" vspace="20">

Options are financial derivatives that gives buyers the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed upon price and date. Various mathematical models are used to evaluate the price of these options. In this project, we will use Monte Carlo and Black Scholes to price the value of options. 

Tools Used: Black Scholes, Monte Carlo, Pandas, Numpy

**Supermarket Sales and Profit Interactive Dashboard**
<img align = "left" src="/docs/assets/dashboard.png" width="480" height="300" hspace="20" vspace="20">

A superstore is a very large supermarket, often selling household goods, clothes, and electrical goods, as well as food. Superstores typically charge anywhere from 15 to 45 percent less than their smaller counterparts. In this project, we will develop an interactive Tableau dashboard to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.

Tools Used: Tableau, Tableau Cloud

**Customer Segmentation**
<img align = "left" src="/docs/assets/scatter.png" width="481" height="355" hspace="20" vspace="20">

Customer Segmentation is the process by which you cluster customers into segments based on common characteristics such as demographics or behaviors, so you can market to those customers more effectively. In this project, we will cluster supermarket customers based on customer data.

Tools Used: Pandas, sklearn, K means clustering, Davies Bouldin Score

**Customer Churn Analysis**
<img align = "left" src="/docs/assets/customer.png" width="500" height="214" hspace="20" vspace="20">

In this project, we will create a model that can predict whether a customer will change telecommunications providers using over 19 input variables. With this analysis, individualed marketing campaigns can be utilized to target such customers. Finally, we create a web application that provides the probability of the customer staying with the provider. 

Tools Used: Flask, Heroku, Python, sklearn, Pandas

**Quantitative Momentum Investing Strategy** 

<img align = "right" src="/docs/assets/stock1.png" width="319" height="255" hspace="20" vspace="20">

In this stock investment strategy, we recommend the stocks with the highest HQM score. The HQM score is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the percentiles of one year price return, six month price return, three month price, return, and one month price return for each stock in the S&P 500 Index.

**Department Deep Structure (Illinois Geometry Lab)**


<img src="/docs/assets/DeepStructure.png" width="388" height="268" hspace="20" vspace="20" class = "center">

What is the structure of the math department at the University of Illinois? The question is not as simple as it seems: the research group composition changes fast, and their impact on the global scale might be smaller or larger than it seems. The goal of this project is to detect research clusters in the math department at the University. 

1. We used python libraries Selenium and BeautifulSoup to web scrape data from MathSciNet, a research database containing mathematical publications, references, citations, etc
2. From this extracted information, we generated distance matrices to represent connections between each pair of faculty in the math department
3. We applied hierarchical clutering algorithms to these distance matrices to generate research clusters between faculty members

**Gut Microbiome Data Science Project (National Center for Supercomputing Applications)**

<img src="/docs/assets/spin.png" width="362" height="269" hspace="20" vspace="20" class = "center">

Diet is a modifiable lifestyle factor that can alter the composition of the human gastrointestinal microbiome. To study these changes, data science techniques can be applied to identify fecal metabolites as objective biomarkers of food consumption. The aim of this project was to identify
significant metabolites and taxonomic groups from five separate randomized, controlled dietary interventions providing almonds, avocados, broccoli, whole grain barley and oats, and walnuts.

1. Data Cleaning/Pre-processing - Separating control vs treatment participants, handling missing values, data normalization, etc
2. Exploratory Data Analysis - Create box and whisker plots for control vs treatment for all metabolites/taxonomic groups
3. Significance Testing - Utilized t test to determine significant metabolites and bacterial groups that caused the most change in the gut microbiome
4. Principal Component Analysis - Generated PCA plots to show if significant clusters between control vs treatment arised for all food interventions
5. Machine Learning Models - Used Random Forest and Logistic Regression to classify food intake from significant metabolites and taxonomic groups

**NFL Big Data Bowl 2022 (Kaggle Competition)**

<img src="/docs/assets/bigdata.png" width="407" height="215" hspace="20" vspace="20" class = "center">

In this project, we create a new metric to evaluate kickers in the NFL. This new metric provides a 'clutchness' rating for the kicker, taking into account both the difficulty of the kick and the situation in the game. 

1. Data Cleaning and Data Collection - Weather data for each game, kicking play data, etc
2. Feature Extraction - Kick Length, Quarter, Time Remaining in game, temperature, etc for each kick of each kicker from 2018-2020
3. Model Building - Created two different models using feed forward neural networks. The first model predicts if a kick was made independent of kicker info. The second model predicts if a kick was made dependent on kicker info. The difference between these models suggests the performance of the kicker.
